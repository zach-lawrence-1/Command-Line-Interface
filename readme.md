# Command line interface in rust

## Personal notes
This is a showcase of my first rust project which will help me to learn and better understand rust. 
As time goes on, improvements will be seen in the projects features, the ways I use different rust features, and my overall coding ability in rust.

## V 0.2 notes
After abandoning a different rust project earlier this summer due to its size and required experience/knowledge I decided to 
continue working on this command line project. I added test cases and the ls command in it's entirety. 
This includes directories now having a blue color, option arguments working now, and the ability of listing multiple 
paths from one input. 
I also modified the command_processing function to include the ability to enter directories that have spaces using either " or ' to enclose the directory. Thanks for reading.
